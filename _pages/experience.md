## Professional & Research Experience

### Bachelor Thesis — Goldenberg Lab, Vector Institute

Jul 2025 – Present · Toronto, Canada

Conducting research on generative models to predict neurological conditions from wearable signals. This thesis builds foundation models that learn from continuous physiological data to enable early diagnosis.

### Research Director — UTMIST, University of Toronto

Jul 2025 – Present · Toronto, Canada

Serving as research director for one of Canada’s largest student‑led AI/ML organizations. I oversee multiple student projects, recruit talented team leads, and connect students with research labs and mentors.

### Research Intern – Robotics — Auton Lab, Carnegie Mellon University

May 2025 – Present · Pittsburgh, USA · Supervisor: Prof. Artur Dubrawski

Developed remote heart‑rate detection algorithms for CMU’s DARPA Triage Challenge team (Chiron). Proposed PRISM, a projection‑based robust interpretable signal mixing method for unsupervised rPPG that outperforms existing SOTA methods and provides uncertainty metrics.

### Research Intern – Computer Vision — Safe‑AI Lab, Carnegie Mellon University

Jul 2024 – May 2025 · Pittsburgh, USA · Supervisor: Prof. Ding Zhao

Created a novel 3D Gaussian splatting framework with feature distillation for dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. Our system enables real‑time rendering and segmentation, surpassing existing methods such as LGS, EndoGaussian and EndoNerf in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS and RMS metrics. It also achieves competitive segmentation performance compared to SAM, SAM2 and MedSAM.

### ML Engineer Intern — PocketHealth

May 2024 – Apr 2025 · Toronto, Canada

Built and fine‑tuned lightweight SAM‑based models for text‑promptable segmentation of organs across CT, X‑Ray, MRI and ultrasound imaging. This work contributed to 33 300 subscription purchases over six months, generating approximately $1.7 million/year in revenue. Developed PocketHealth Explainer, an LLM tool that simplifies radiology reports with a 98 % user satisfaction rating, increasing subscription conversion by 18 %. Also fine‑tuned DistilBERT models for automated lung nodule and follow‑up detection.

### Research Intern – Computational Pathology — Multimedia Lab, University of Toronto

May 2023 – Present · Toronto, Canada · Supervisor: Prof. Konstantinos N. Plataniotis

Published a histological dataset of 20k annotated colon images for deep learning. Built a tissue annotation platform to assist pathologists. Developed computer‑vision models (VMamba) to discover tissue biomarkers for colon polyps and benchmarked self‑supervised learning methods (MAE, SimCLRv2) for representation learning.

### Research Intern – Machine Learning — IC2 Lab, King Mongkut University of Technology

May 2022 – Aug 2022 · Bangkok, Thailand · Supervisor: Prof. Jonathan H. Chan

Developed a deep‑learning pipeline using PyTorch 3D U‑Net and the MONAI framework to segment gastrointestinal organs in CT scans, facilitating radiotherapy planning for cancer patients. Integrated explainable AI techniques such as Grad‑CAM and DeepLIFT to visualise salient features and improve interpretability.
