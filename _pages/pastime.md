description: Pastimes and personal interests.

When I’m not immersed in research or coursework, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me balanced and inspired. I’m an avid snowboarder who loves carving down slopes in the winter, I enjoy playing basketball to stay active, and I cherish travelling with my family to experience new places together. I also find relaxation and challenge in playing the piano and am currently working my way through Chopin’s Ballade No. 1 in G minor.
