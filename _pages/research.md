## Research Interests

My primary interest lies in applying machine learning to biomedical data to unlock insights that can support clinicians and improve patient care. Below are some of the areas I am currently exploring or have recently worked on.

### Foundation models for wearables
Wearable sensors produce continuous streams of physiological data. I build scalable models that learn representations from these signals and enable early detection of neurological and cardiovascular conditions.

### Remote PPG algorithms
I develop remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods that estimate heart rate from videos. These algorithms support contactless triage in disaster settings and deliver interpretable uncertainty metrics through projection‑based mixing.

### Surgical scene reconstruction
Using 4D Gaussian splatting and feature distillation, I design systems that reconstruct dynamic surgical scenes from endoscopic footage. The goal is real‑time rendering and segmentation of complex deformable environments.

### Medical image segmentation
I employ foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment organs and pathologies in CT, MRI, X‑ray and ultrasound scans. Lightweight architectures and text‑promptable designs make these tools accessible to clinicians.

### LLMs for radiology report interpretation
Large language models can demystify complex radiology reports. I work on fine‑tuning language models to generate patient‑friendly explanations and flag follow‑up recommendations, enhancing understanding and adherence.

### Computational pathology
By publishing large histopathological datasets and building representation learning pipelines, I aim to discover visual biomarkers associated with diseases such as colorectal polyps. Self‑supervised learning techniques like Masked Autoencoders and SimCLRv2 are key tools in this domain.
