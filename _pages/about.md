Hey there! I’m Kai, a fourth‑year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in Machine Intelligence. I work at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, building intelligent and practical systems to support clinicians and improve patient outcomes.

Here you can learn more about my research interests, publications, experiences and hobbies. Please explore and reach out if interested!

## Research Synopsis

I focus on leveraging machine learning for health. Recently I’ve explored topics including:

- Foundation models on wearable physiological signals for sleep staging and neurological disease detection
- Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) algorithms for stand‑off heart‑rate detection to support medical triage
- 4D‑Gaussian splatting with feature distillation for dynamic surgical scene reconstruction
- Foundation models for radiological image segmentation and radiology report interpretation
- Computational pathology for biomarker discovery
